                <h1>LDH KID INFILTRATES EOM SENIOR SUNSET</h1>
                <p1>September 13th, 2024</p1>
                <p2>
                    <br><br>With being a senior comes tons and <i>tons</i> of senior-related events, one of them being the Senior Sunset. 
                    <br><br>Honestly, I personally don't often participate in these events, because I'm usually busy with dance, school, or whatnot. But this time around, I was free. And, really, it's my last year of high school, wouldn't it be a waste to <i>not</i> participate in all the senior events?
                    <br><br>Now the problem: <i>who to go with</i>. I asked around a bit, but any answers I got were vague, and no one knew if they were coming for sure. So, what did I do? I texted Niki (the aforementioned LDH kid). <i>Surprise surprise.</i> And she said yes!
                    <br><br>And so, the day arrived. We met up at Kanata Centrum's Coco for some bubble tea and, naturally, to look at the stationary, of course. I suggested walking over, and we headed off. 
                    <br><br>We eventually made it with our limbs intact (and only having spilled a <i>little</i> bit of bubble tea on my white skirt), and we just walked around, talking to different people from my school. We had a lot of fun, honestly, and the pictures turned out amazing! Everyone kept on referring to her as the “Famous Niki”, though… <i>Do I really talk about her that much…</i>
                    <br><br>The only downside: mosquitoes. Who decided to host this on a <i>field…</i> 
                    <br><br>After an hour or so, we had already suffered enough mosquito bites, and it was getting dark, so we got picked up by my mom.
                    <br><br>We got to my place, and after scouring our medicine cupboards, I eventually found some Claritin, and oh boy, was it a blessing.
                    <br><br>At the end of the day, though, despite the mosquitoes, we both had a lot of fun. I'm really happy I went and got Niki to come along, too, because I really do want to get the full senior experience of high school, and I'm glad I get to do it with a friend.
