                <h1>KELLY SONG: IN CONCERT</h1>
                <p1>September 21st, 2024</p1>
                <p2>
                    <br><br>Kelly concert day!!
                    <br><br>The day had started out pretty interesting, actually. I had been practising driving with my dad in a parking lot for a while, when he suggested I drive us home. I knew he could tell I was getting a lot more comfortable on the road, and this was my next step, so I said yes. It was a pretty smooth ride over, actually, even though I was super stressed to see cars around me. I only got honked at once because apparently I took a split second too long at a left turn, but even my dad thinks that was an overreaction on the other driver's part.
                    <br><br>Either way, I made it home without inflicting any damage on our car, and went to get ready for the concert.
                    <br><br>Hayley picked me up from my place, and then we drove over to Emily's to get her and Lily. Only <i>then</i> did I realise that <i>I forgot my ticket</i>. As it turns out, though, Hayley is quite a smart cookie - she planned loads of time in advance, so we were able to go back to my place and still make it there on time.
                    <br><br>When we arrived to Carleton, we parked, and Hayley and I (the parents) stood there for a bit, trying to figure out how the parking ticket machine worked, while Emily and Lily (the children) stood on the side, clueless.
                    <br><br>Eventually, we got into the building, and met a few friends there. We decided to all sit together, and after a bit of waiting, the show had started.
                    <br><br>When Kelly came on, I think it's safe to say we were all so proud of her - I know I was. She was so amazing, and throughout the few hours there, I constantly found myself thinking that I was really glad that I had come to her show. We had so much fun cheering her on, and when the show wrapped up, we all came to congratulate her and say our goodbyes.
                    <br><br>Hayley, Emily, Lily and I hung around to take some pictures before heading back to Kanata for some food. We decided on Subway as our late-night meal spot, and yapped for a while while eating our food. I had a lot of fun talking with them, and I felt like we really connected.
                    <br><br>By the time I came home, I felt fulfilled. It had been a really healing weekend, and I felt well-rested as I headed into the school week.
