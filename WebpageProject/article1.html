                <h1>AYDEN, NIKI AND JULIA REUNITE AFTER 4 LONG MONTHS</h1>
                <p>
                    After four seemingly endless months apart, Ayden, Niki, and Julia—the legends behind the infamous <i>haterz</i> group chat—finally reunited. It was as if the planets had finally aligned, bringing Ayden back from what Niki and Julia had begun calling “The Eternal Trip to China.” To say they'd missed each other was an understatement; these three can hardly last a week apart without spiraling into melodrama. Naturally, they decided to reunite in style—though of course, someone had to document it for <i>future generations</i>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>The rendezvous point? <i>Social Thai</i>, a cozy café chosen for its unassuming vibe (and solid lighting, because obviously, pictures were happening). They slid into their seats, and just like that, it was as if Ayden had never left. The tea—literal and metaphorical—was flowing. Ayden's stories from China had all the classic hallmarks: wild adventures, cheap street food, and picturesque spots that practically begged for a photo op. Meanwhile, Niki and Julia regaled Ayden with tales of their “exhilarating” lives back home, which mostly involved navigating the horrors of suburbia without Ayden's sharp commentary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>After sufficiently interrogating Ayden about every single moment abroad, the trio took on the brave task of deciding what to do next. They were still hungry for adventure (or maybe just dessert), so they did what any self-respecting group of friends would do: hit up <i>Lansdowne Cineplex</i> to catch <i>The Wild Robot</i>. Now, let's be clear—this wasn't just any movie. It was essentially the cinematic equivalent of therapy, and, yes, they did cry (multiple times). Not that they'd ever admit it, of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>In a twist that surprised everyone, including the trio themselves, Niki drove them to the theater without a single near-death experience. For context, this is the same Niki known for making lane changes with the unpredictability of a cat chasing a laser pointer. Yet somehow, they arrived intact, even managing to get a decent parking spot, though Ayden half-jokingly suggested submitting it to Guinness World Records as Niki's most accident-free drive to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>The night wrapped up with all the classic moments: inside jokes that got a little weirder, epic side-eyes, and reluctant goodbyes. As they walked back to their cars, the weight of those four long months apart felt like a distant memory. Despite time zones, continents, and Niki's chaotic driving, they'd once again proved that some friendships are just built different.
