        <div class="article-text">
            <p>After four long months apart, Ayden, Niki, and Julia—the unstoppable trio from the <i>haterz</i> group chat—finally reunited, much to their excitement. Ayden had been in China for what felt like an eternity to Niki and Julia (the kids who can hardly stand being apart for more than a week). Now, with the squad almost complete (missing only one member), the long-awaited reunion was on!<br><br>The trio met up at <i>Social Thai</i>, a cozy little café that perfectly matched their vibe. The atmosphere buzzed with energy as they sat down to catch up on everything that had happened during Ayden's time abroad. From the adventures in China to life back home, the conversation flowed as easily as ever, and the laughter didn't stop.<br><br>After eating some delicious food and reminiscing about old times, they headed over to Lansdowne Cineplex to catch a screening of <i>The Wild Robot</i> and only cried twice. To everyone's relief (and some surprise), Niki drove them over <i>without</i> crashing her car—a notable achievement indeed.<br><br>The day was filled with warmth, laughter, and that irreplaceable feeling of reconnecting with close friends after being apart for too long. Though four months was a long time to wait, the reunion was a reminder that no distance or time can truly separate the bond they share.</p>
