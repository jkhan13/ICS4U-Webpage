                <h1>AYDEN, NIKI AND JULIA REUNITE AFTER 4 LONG MONTHS</h1>
                <p1>October 14th, 2024</p1>
                <p2>
                    <br><br>The day is June 28th, 2024, Toronto. Ayden, Camille and I have just come back to our airbnb from the <i>ITZY</i> concert, when suddenly, Ayden is informed that his flight to Vancouver has been cancelled by WestJet. He spends the next two days trying to figure it all out, and somehow, after sleeping at an airport, a sketchy hotel, and frequent naps on any random bench in between, he makes it. A few days later, he departs to China, and so it begins: <i>The Eternal Trip to China.</i>
                    <br><br>A month or so later, I'm hanging out with Bryan and Niki, and the topic of <i>Ayden</i> comes up again (he's just a strange fella, there's a lot to talk about). And so, this is when I found out that he never purchased a ticket back to Canada (of course, why would he, right?). I talked to him about this later, and yeah, he didn't buy a ticket back because he wasn't sure how long he was going to stay?? No lie, the first thing I said was: <i>"You're such a loser"</i>, because really, what?? I'm supposed to survive an entire summer without you??? How is that supposed to happen?
                    <br><br>And I swear I'm not crazy, because Niki shared the exact same sentiment. And so, the two of us spent almost the entire summer together (literally, we would go max two weeks without seeing each other, and even that had us spiralling into melodrama), constantly complaining about when this idiot (lovingly) would get back, because we missed his chaos.
                    <br><br>It took until October for this man to show back up in the country… <i>October</i>. 
                    <br><br>Naturally, I harassed him into hanging out the second I heard, and here we have it, folks: <i>The Reunion of the Century</i>.
                    <br><br>Ayden, Niki and I all met up for pad thai, coffee and dessert (and pictures!) at a café called Social Thai, and yapped for hours. After sufficiently interrogating him on everything that happened over the last 4 months, and bringing our own updates to the table, too, we decided to go catch a 3-D screening of <i>The Wild Robot</i> at Lansdowne Cineplex. 
                    <br><br>We headed over in Niki's car, and I am happy to say no one was harmed in the journey (there were a few <i>questionable</i> parking decisions made but that was about it). 
                    <br><br>The movie, I have to say, was incredible, and made all of us cry like little babies, not once, but twice (good thing we took pictures <i>beforehand</i>).
                    <br><br>After that, we just walked around a bit and then headed back to Niki's (through winding roads galore as she doesn't want to drive on the highway yet).
                    <br><br>But honestly, though, disregarding all my joking insults, as the day wrapped up, all I could think about was how much fun I had. The three of us made a promise to each other to hang out more often, because these are the types of experiences that we live for: the ones that light up our boring day-to-day with something a little more meaningful.
